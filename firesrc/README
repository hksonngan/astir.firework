2- How to install

   2.1- First configure
      If you want use Nvidia GPU stuff, run this command to bash shell:
   	  ~: ./configure

	  Otherwise if you do not have any Nvidia gears, you can compile without GPU support:
	  ~: ./configure --nocuda

   2.2- Setup path and environment
      In order to compile and call firework anywhere from your system you have to set some PATH.
	  If your Linux was setup with bash shell, open your .bashrc file and add:
   
   	  # where is python (usefull if you using different python version)
	  export PYTHONDIR=/usr
	  export PATH=$PATH:$PYTHONDIR/bin
	  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PYTHONDIR/lib

	  # where is FIREwork
	  export FIREDIR=/home/FIREwork    <- Here you have to change according where you put FIREwork
	  export PATH=$PATH:$FIREDIR/firebin
  	  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$FIREDIR/firelib:$FIREDIR/firebin
   	  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$FIREDIR/firelib
   
   2.3- Compile and install
	  ~: make && make install
